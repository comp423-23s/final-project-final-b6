## Implementation Notes

Our application includes entities for:

1. Events,
2. Organizations,
3. Permissions,
4. Users,
5. User roles,
6. The relationship between a user and an organizaiton,
7. The relationship between an organization and its events

### A further elaboration on the entities that we created and modified

An event entity is composed of fields representing:

1. An event id,
2. An event name,
3. An event desctiption,
4. An event time and date,
5. An event location,
6. An event image,
7. And an organiztion id relating it to an existing organiztion

An organization entity is composed of fields representing:

1. An organization id,
2. An organization name,
3. An organization overview,
4. An organization description,
5. An organization image,
6. And a list of users


### Interesting design choices we made

We chose to make event and organization names unique as we figured this would encourage creative organization/ event names and make it easier to find a specific organization/ event.  

We chose to order organization events in the order of soonest occuring first in order to make it easier for students to view upcoming events and be able to adjust and plan accordingly.  We think this is a more convienient choice rather than ordering alphabetically as it is more intuitive to the end user.


## Development Concerns

#### If a new developer wanted to start working on your feature, what kind of guidance or overview would you give them to get them started?
##### We would advise them to look over this very markdown file.

#### What files would you point them at?
##### We would point them to the test files, the api folder, and the services folder to grasp a primary understanding of the backend and EXAMPLE1, EXAMPLE2, and EXAMPLE3 for them to understand the frontend.

#### Is there anything special they would need to do to get started?
##### They would need to set up a development enviorment to work on and contribute to our feature.


## Future Work

With more time, our feature could be slightly expanded.  One idea is to add a way to filter and or sort organizations.
