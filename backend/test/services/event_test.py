Members who have a culture or multiple cultures listed online will have the chance to show their cultures at Festival Assembly, which is held once per year. We will invite all UNC students to come to our Festival Assembly. Respect: We hold workshops for lectures and discussions. We will invite professors, graduate students, researchers, and other scholars in academia to educate us about culture. We will also invite other cultural organizations to talk about connections or differences among cultures together. Respecting each other's cultural identities is our priority. Support: We hold Culture Support Community and Culture Support Service to support both international students and endangered cultures. We will have an online community chat group for students to connect, and we will hold regular meetings for students to share their stories and support each other. As for Culture Support Service, we will offer a channel to encourage people worldwide to look for and collect endangered cultures. We will work together to discover how to commit to preserving global cultural identities and bring endangered cultures back.",
