"""Organization routes are used by the application to interact with organizations associated with UNC.

The application mainly interacts with the functions in this file by the way of get requests used to
display organizations, a post request to create an organization, a patch request to edit an existing 
organization, and a delete request to delete a specified organiztion.

Routes in this file are pre-fixed with an endpoint of: "/api/organizations".
