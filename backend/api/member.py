"""Member routes are used by the applicaiton to interact with user objects and how they interact with organizaitons.

The application mainly interacts with the funcitons in this file by the way of a post request to add a member to an 
organization, as well as a get request to return a list of all the members of a given organization.

Routes in this file are pre-fixed with an endpoint of "/api/{organization_name}/members"
